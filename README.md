# grunt-type [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alvivi/grunt-type.png)](http://travis-ci.org/alvivi/grunt-type)

> Compile TypeScipt source code.


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how
to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install
and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install
this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-copy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with
this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-copy');
```

*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt
v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that
[you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4).*
